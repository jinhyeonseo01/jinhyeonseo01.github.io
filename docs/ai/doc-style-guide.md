# Documentation Style Guide

## Principles
- Keep docs decision-focused and implementation-ready.
- Prefer short sections with explicit file references.
- Record irreversible choices in ADR files.

## Writing rules
- Use Markdown headers with clear scope.
- Include status for architecture decisions.
- Avoid duplicating source code; reference paths instead.
- Keep examples consistent with actual route and type contracts.

## Update rules
- Update `docs/INDEX.md` when adding/removing docs.
- Update ADR sequence (`ADR-000X`) in chronological order.
- Keep AI schemas in sync with runtime type contracts.
